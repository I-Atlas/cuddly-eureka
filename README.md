mode.

To make full use of the software product we have implemented a system of
registration and authorization system. Then the user has the ability to download

correctness of operations and returns a report. In the report, each refund request gets
one of three statuses:

- the request has passed the check;

We used TypeScript as our programming language, we have Node.js with Express on the backend, we used MongoDB as our database, the frontend uses the Next.js framework built over the React library, which has been the "production standard" in the frontend world for years. It's all wrapped in docker containers and run with a single command "docker-compose up"

We also made the visual pleasant for the user, there are animations and change of theme (light and dark)
